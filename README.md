# Peer-2-Peer Blockchain Network using Golang

### Getting started

This is inspired by [this blog post](https://medium.com/@mycoralhealth/code-a-simple-p2p-blockchain-in-go-46662601f417) and [this github repo](https://github.com/mycoralhealth/blockchain-tutorial/tree/master/p2p).

See [05-p2p-block-struct](https://github.com/sumantabose/go-p2p-blockchain/tree/master/05-p2p-block-struct) for latest version.

`06-p2p-heroku` is work under progress (currently incomplete) and may not be completed any time soon.
